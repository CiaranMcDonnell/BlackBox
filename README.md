### Black Box Game

This is a Java implementation of the classic Black Box Game by Eric Solomon. The project was designed for COMP20050.

### The Game
Black Box is a strategic board game that challenges players to deduce the positions of hidden atoms within a hexagonal grid by observing the paths of rays they send into the grid. The game consists of a hexagonal grid of 61 hexagons, within which a certain number of atoms are secretly placed by one player. The other player, or players, sends rays into the grid from the perimeter hexagons, attempting to deduce the atoms' locations based on how these rays are deflected, absorbed, or pass straight through the grid.

The key objective for the guessing players is to accurately determine the positions of all hidden atoms with the least number of rays sent into the grid, as each ray used adds to the player's score, and a lower score is better. The game effectively combines elements of strategy, logic, and deduction, requiring players to make educated guesses based on the observed behavior of the rays in response to the hidden atoms.
